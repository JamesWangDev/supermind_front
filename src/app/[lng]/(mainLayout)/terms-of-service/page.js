                <p>This section covers any disputes that might arise between you and SuperMind AI in connection with these Terms. You commit to contacting us at <a href="mailto:admin@supermind.com">admin@supermind.com</a> to try to resolve any disputes you may have with us over SuperMind informally for at least 30 days. The dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration (instead of going to court) if we are unable to settle it informally within 30 days. However, if certain claims qualify, you may bring them individually in small claims court. Within 30 days of accepting these Terms, you may request to opt out of arbitration by sending an email to the email address above along with your name and request to opt out of arbitration.</p>
                <div className="mt-4" style={{fontWeight: 600}}>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</div>
                <p>These Terms and all aspects of SuperMind shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, US, without regard to conflict of law and its principles. With respect to any disputes not subject to Informal Resolution or Binding Arbitration, you agree not to commence or prosecute any action other than in the State and Federal courts located in the State of New York. You hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such courts. </p>
                <div className="mt-4" style={{fontWeight: 600}}>Binding Arbitration</div>
                <p>If we are unable to resolve any dispute within 30 days of your notice, either you or SuperMind AI may elect to have the dispute settled by Binding Arbitration subject to the terms described herein (excluding the exceptions below). Any election to arbitrate by either party shall be binding on the other. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted in line with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Application (AAA), and where appropriate, the AAA’s supplementary procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules). Both rules may be found on the AAA’s website at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. The decision of a dispute being qualified for arbitration shall be determined using the Federal Arbitration Act in a court rather than by an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and share of the arbitration compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted through the submission of documents, in person, by phone, or online by mutual agreement. The arbitrator shall pass judgment in writing but need not provide reasons unless either of us requests. If the arbitrator does not follow applicable laws, either you or SuperMind AI may challenge the arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>
                <div className="mt-4" style={{fontWeight: 600}}>Arbitration Restrictions</div>
                <p>You hereby agree that arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between you and SuperMind AI. To the maximum extent permitted by law, no arbitration shall be joined with another; no dispute shall be arbitrated on a class-action basis or utilize class-action procedures, and no dispute shall be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of another person or the public.</p>
                <div className="mt-4" style={{fontWeight: 600}}>Exceptions</div>
                <p>You hereby agree that the following disputes shall not be subject to informal resolution or binding arbitration: </p>
                <ul className="mt-4 ms-4">
                    <div>(i)	any dispute seeking to enforce or protect (or concerning the validity of) any party’s intellectual property rights;</div>
